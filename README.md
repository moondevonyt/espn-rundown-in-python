```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode
```bash
python main.py

- `75 arb` - 75 minutes starting with Stat Arb Bots
- `90 search` - 90 minutes starting with Researching  
- `45` - 45 minutes, random order
- `backtesting` - 60 minutes (default) starting with Backtesting
- `60 build a computer` - 60 minutes starting with new task "build a computer"

### Command Line Arguments
```bash
python main.py 75 arb                # 75 minutes starting with Stat Arb
python main.py 90 search             # 90 minutes starting with Researching
python main.py 45                    # 45 minutes, random order
python main.py backtesting           # 60 minutes starting with Backtesting
python main.py 60 build a computer   # 60 minutes starting with new task
```

### Controls
- **Enter**: Advance to next project
- **r**: Restart current project timer
- **q**: Quit

## Projects

Current trading bot projects:
- Stat Arb Bots
- Polymarket Bots
- Hyperliquid Bots
- Solana Bots
- Backtesting
- Researching

Edit the `PROJECTS` list in `main.py` to customize your projects.

## Configuration

- **Default Time**: 60 minutes per project (change `DEFAULT_MINUTES` in main.py)
- **Project Search**: Partial matches work (e.g., "arb" finds "Stat Arb Bots")
- **New Tasks**: Unknown search terms become new tasks (e.g., "build a computer" creates new task)
- **Auto-Loop**: Automatically reshuffles when all projects complete

## Sound Configuration

To enable completion sounds when projects finish:

1. **Enable Sound**: Set `SOUND_ENABLED = True` in main.py
2. **Set Sound Path**: Update `SOUND_FILE_PATH` to your sound file location
3. **Supported Formats**: WAV files work best across all platforms

```python
# ðŸ”Š Sound configuration
SOUND_ENABLED = True  # Set to True to enable sounds
SOUND_FILE_PATH = "/path/to/your/sound.wav"  # Path to your sound file
```

**Note**: You'll need to provide your own sound file. The rundown will work perfectly without sound if disabled.
